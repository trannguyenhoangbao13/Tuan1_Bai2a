        <h2>&#160Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) &ensp;</h2>
        <br>
        <p>&#160The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, Leonhard Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of &#160mathematics, Jean Bernoulli. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at
            St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the &#160most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and papers. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. &#160Euler's work on mathematical analysis,
            Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748) remained a standard textbook for well over a century. For the &#160princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical outline of the main
            physical &#160theories of the time.
        </p><br>
        <p>&#160One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps best &#160known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &#160cos(x) + isin(x) = e (ix)</p><br>
        <p>&#160demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation
        </p><br>
        <p>&#160e(pi i) + 1 = 0 </p><br>
        <p>&#160which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, pi, e, and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement.
        </p><br>
        <p>&#160Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.
